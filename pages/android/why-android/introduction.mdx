# Why Android? ðŸ“±

Before we talk about why Android, let's talk about why mobile?

## Why Mobile?

Smartphones are really just small computers you can carry around in your pocket. Small, but powerful. Due to their smaller screen and touch-based interface, browsing the web on a smartphone is still often a sub-optimal experience.
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) improve the experience somewhat, but nothing beats a good old native Mobile App designed from the ground up with mobile experience in mind.

  <b>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)ðŸ¤”</b>: A PWA is a website that looks and
  behaves as if it is a mobile app. PWAs are built to take advantage of native
  mobile device features, without requiring the end user to visit an app store,
  make a purchase and download software locally.

## Why Android?

You might be wondering? Why Android? Why not iOS? Or Windows Phone?
Okay let me convince you with a fact why Android is the best choice for you.ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Žâš¡

In 2020, the number of smartphone users in the world is 3.5 billion, which translates to 45.12% of the world's population owning a smartphone.
Looking at the global market share for mobile phones we can see Android and iOS clearly in the lead.

  </div>

So basically you can see that the biggest share of the market is owned by Android. So it's a good choice to start with Android.

  <b>NOTE: </b>
  We are not saying that iOS is not a good choice. It's just that Android is a better
  choice for beginners, to start writing Android Apps we only need a laptop regardless
  of the type for IOS you must use a macbook. Also, as you might have noted the experience
  of using a website in a mobile browser is not as good as using a native app.
