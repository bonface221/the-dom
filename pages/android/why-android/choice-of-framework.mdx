## What is the best language to learn Android Development?

Now this depends on what you know already. Ask yourself this question:
What language do I know already? If you know Java, then you can start learning Android Development with Java. If you know Kotlin, then you can start learning Android Development with Kotlin.
personally I knew **Javascript** and so I learnt Android Development with React Native

**What if I'm a beginner and I don't know any language?**
If you are a beginner and you don't know any language, then I will advice you to learn **Kotlin** because it's a good language and later on you can also shift to IOS dev with the same language and it's also a very good language to learn.
