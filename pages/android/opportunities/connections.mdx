# Building connections

# --------------------

## Connect with people with the same interest

You can find people with the same interest e.g in linkedin groups, facebook groups, twitter, etc. You can also find people in your local area by searching for meetups.
Provide value to them by sharing your knowledge and experience. You can also ask them questions and learn from them.

## Attending meetups

Imagine this: I hear of an opportunity for an android developer somewhere. Who will I recommend?
I will recommend the person I know. The person I have met. The person I have seen his work. The person I have interacted with.
I will not recommend a stranger. I will not recommend someone I have not met. I will not recommend someone I have not seen his work.

## Building your network

Build your network and you will always have refferals. You will always have people who will recommend you for opportunities.
